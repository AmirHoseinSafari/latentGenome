epigenomic_data = znormed, arcsinh transformed signals in a matrix form with dimension 1030*1926400 (after decimating each signal to 25bp resolution and 1030 are number of assays)

for task in tasks:
    downstream_windows (gene, pe window, fire) = dataframe consisting of columns window_start, window_end and label, with number of rows equalling the number of windows.

    # downstream_windows are given at 1bp resolution therefore we need to convert these positions to 25bp resolution to match it with the epigenomic data used to train the model.

    downstream_windows_25bp = convert the downstream_windows to 25 bp resolution
