Data = reduce the epigenomic data to 25 bp resolution leading to ~1926400 length data and train the model

gen_positions = Obtain the genomic positions along with respective labels for a particular downstream task (e.g. gene expression).
                These genomic positions are given as windows. Consider every position in the window.

gen_positions_25bp = convert the gen_positions to 25 bp resolution to get features from the trained model


for task in downstream_tasks:

    for c in cells:

        hidden_features = get features from the trained model at gen_positions_25bp

        hidden_features_neg = some tasks dont have negative labels. Create these labels at other positions and obtain the features

        map = train and evaluate using xgboost classifier
